# AirlineSatisfaction
 A Machine learning approach (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to investigate customer satisfaction in the airline industry based on 130k reviews (Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction))

 This paper will explore the steps and procedures used to investigate customer satisfaction in the airline industry. Our analysis will be based on the results of 129,880 satisfaction survey results, which will enable us to draw statistically valid conclusions that our clients can use and adopt into their daily operations. It is well established that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty , and similarly customer loyalty drives profitability and organizational growth. With this in mind our objective is to clearly identify what are the key determinants that lead to a satisfied customer.
